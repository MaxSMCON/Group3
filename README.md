#  Poject Submission deadline : August 15th 2022

1. Create an interactive visualization of Crime based on available data on Kaggle (i.e. Chicago Crime: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chicago/chicago-crime/metadata).
2. Create an ETL to process large data sets (i.e. financial data from distinct sources into a single model).
3. Utilize the YouTube DatSet (https://research.google.com/youtube8m/index.html), but not sure to what extent. Seems like an interesting DataSet to explore further.
4. Fast data processing pipeline for predicting flight delays using Spark and Machine Learning. https://developer.hpe.com/blog/fast-data-processing-pipeline-for-predicting-flight-delays-using-apache-/
5. SMS Spam Collection https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset
